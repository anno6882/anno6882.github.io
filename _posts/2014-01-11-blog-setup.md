## Hello World
With this post, i've sucessfully found out how to setup a blog hosted by [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/)
using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole).

## Blog setup wrapup
The procedure is documented very good at [joshualandes blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)
I've done only minimal 'additions', like adding a navigation bar at the top of each post to quickly navigate through the posts or removing the related posts section, because it seems to only show the posts which are nearest by date.
